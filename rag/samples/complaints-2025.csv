Closing account,Account Closure,"I am filing this complaint against Citibank regarding the improper closure of my account, discriminatory practices, and failure to validate an alleged debt. I believe Citibanks actions violate several federal and state consumer protection laws, including : Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) New York General Business Law ( GBL ) section 349 Details of the Issue : 1. I opened my account with Citibank on XX/XX/2023, and it was abruptly closed in XX/XX/2023 without sufficient explanation or notice. 
2. Citibank representatives claim the account was closed because I refused to pay, which is untrue. I was exercising my right to dispute a payment under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), not refusing to pay. Disputing a payment is a protected right and does not constitute grounds for account closure.

Closing account,Account Closure,"My name is XXXX XXXX, and I have been a loyal Bank of America customer for several years. I am writing to express my concern about the sudden closure of my two credit card accounts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted customer service to inquire about my accounts and was informed that they had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX due to either late payments or a high balance. This decision has caused me significant distress, as I have never been late on any payments. Additionally, I am aware that other customers with high balances have not faced similar actions. 

The abrupt closure of these accounts poses a serious risk to my credit score and financial stability. I am also concerned that my checking account may be at risk of being closed without notice. This situation has left me feeling both disappointed and uncertain about my relationship with the bank.

To resolve this issue, I respectfully request a thorough review of my accounts and the reasons for their closure. If possible, I would like to have my credit card accounts ","BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL

I have been an Aspire customer for over five years and have never missed a payment with any creditor before this incident. This late payment is the only negative mark on my credit history and was caused solely by the mismanagement of Aspires account communications.

Purchases,Purchase Dispute,"Complaint Regarding Dispute Handling and Failure to Refund Seller Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a complaint against Apple Card regarding their handling of a dispute that was rebilled to me as the customer. Despite their decision to hold me responsible for the payment, they have failed to return the corresponding funds to the merchant. 

This behavior appears to constitute mismanagement of funds and raises concerns of potential embezzlement. I have contacted Apple Card to request proof that the funds were refunded to the seller, but they have either refused or failed to provide any such evidence. 

I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter thoroughly, as it reflects a serious breach of ethical and legal standards. Attached, you will find all relevant documentation, including transaction details, dispute communication records, and rebill notices.
